`xtee` is a versatile command-line utility handy in taking a single stream of input, from standard input, and splitting it into two outputs, standard output and file.

## Installation

### Install release binaries (without Go installed)

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/hueristiq/xtee/releases) and find the appropriate archive for your operating system and architecture. Download the archive from your browser or copy its URL and retrieve it with `wget` or `curl`:

* ...with `wget`:

	```bash
	wget https://github.com/hueristiq/xtee/releases/download/v<version>/xtee-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

* ...or, with `curl`:

	```bash
	curl -OL https://github.com/hueristiq/xtee/releases/download/v<version>/xtee-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
	```

...then, extract the binary:

```bash
tar xf xtee-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> [!TIP]
> The above steps, download and extract, can be combined into a single step with this onliner
> 
> ```bash
> curl -sL https://github.com/hueristiq/xtee/releases/download/v<version>/xtee-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> On Windows systems, you should be able to double-click the zip archive to extract the `xtee` executable.

...move the `xtee` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

```bash
sudo mv xtee /usr/local/bin/
```

> [!NOTE]
> Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xtee` to their `PATH`.

### Install source (with Go installed)

Before you install from source, you need to make sure that Go is installed on your system. You can install Go by following the official instructions for your operating system. For this, we will assume that Go is already installed.

#### `go install ...`

```bash
go install -v github.com/hueristiq/xtee/cmd/xtee@latest
```

#### `go build ...` the development version

* Clone the repository

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/hueristiq/xtee.git 
	```

* Build the utility

	```bash
	cd xtee/cmd/xtee && \
	go build .
	```

* Move the `xtee` binary to somewhere in your `PATH`. For example, on GNU/Linux and OS X systems:

	```bash
	sudo mv xtee /usr/local/bin/
	```

	Windows users can follow [How to: Add Tool Locations to the PATH Environment Variable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) in order to add `xtee` to their `PATH`.


> [!CAUTION]
> While the development version is a good way to take a peek at `xtee`'s latest features before they get released, be aware that it may have bugs. Officially released versions will generally be more stable.

## Usage

To display help message for `xtee` use the `-h` flag:

```bash
xtee -h
```

help message:

```text

      _
__  _| |_ ___  ___
\ \/ / __/ _ \/ _ \
 >  <| ||  __/  __/
/_/\_\\__\___|\___|
             v0.3.0

USAGE:
 xtee [OPTION]... <FILE>

INPUT OPTIONS:
     --soak bool        soak up all input before writing to file

OUTPUT OPTIONS:
 -u, --unique bool      output unique lines
 -a, --append bool      append lines to output
 -q, --quiet bool       suppress output to stdout
 -p, --preview bool     preview new lines, without writing to file

pflag: help requested
```

* Appending Unique Lines to File

	```
	➜  cat stuff.txt
	one
	two
	three

	➜  cat new-stuff.txt
	zero
	one
	two
	three
	four
	five

	➜  cat new-stuff.txt | xtee stuff.txt --append --unique
	zero
	four
	five

	➜  cat stuff.txt
	one
	two
	three
	zero
	four
	five

	```

	Note that the new lines added to `stuff.txt` are also sent to `stdout`, this allows for them to be redirected to another file:

	```
	➜  cat new-stuff.txt | xtee stuff.txt --append --unique > added-lines.txt
	➜  cat added-lines.txt
	zero
	four
	five
	```

* Deduplicating Files

	```
	➜  cat stuff.txt
	zero
	one
	two
	three
	zero
	four
	five
	five

	➜  cat stuff.txt | xtee stuff.txt --soak --unique
	zero
	one
	two
	three
	four
	five

	➜  cat stuff.txt
	zero
	one
	two
	three
	four
	five

	```

	Note the use of `--soak`, it makes the utility soak up all its input before writing to a file. This is useful for reading from and writing to the same file in a single pipeline.
